(a+b)%m = ((a%m)+(b%m))%m;
(a/b)%m = ((a%m)*((b^-1)%m))%m;

Todayâ€™s goal is to calculate (b^-1)%m.
-> Modulo inverse of b.

Modulo Multiplicative Inverse.

(a*x)%n = 1
Then it is known as the modulo inverse of a w.r.t n = x = (a^-1).
And   1<=x<=(n-1)
And it will exist only when gcd(a,n)=1;

When ever you found gcd(a,n)=1 then you may write it like
a*x+n*y=1;

Here 
x-> modulo inverse of a w.r.t n = (a^-1)%n;
	Take modulo w.r.t n on LHS and RHS then
		(a*x)%n = 1
y-> modulo inverse of n w.r.t a;
	Take modulo w.r.t a on LHS and RHS then
		(n*y)%a = 1




Important Property
	(a^ETF(p))%p = 1 (always)
		Where a and p are coprime i.e gcd(a,p)=1;

	If p is a prime number then ETF(p) = p-1;
		
		(a^(p-1))%p = 1 (Fermat's Little Theorem)
		(a*(a^(p-2))*)%p = 1;
		-> (a*x)%p=1 where x=a^-1
	So x = a^(p-2)
	     [(a^(-1))%p = (a^(p-2))%p][

-> Final outcome-> 
modulo inverse of a w.r.t m((a^-1)%m) is equal to ((a^(m-2))%m; [m is prime number].

	x=(a^-1)%m; 1<=x<=(m-1)


Last property-> (a^z)%m = (a^(z%ETF(m)))%m;

Note-> In 99% of the cases you would find m as a prime number.
Find modulo with m = 10e9+7; (prime number);
